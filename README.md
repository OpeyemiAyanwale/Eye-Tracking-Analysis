# Eye Tracking Analysis
Eye-tracking is a widely employed tool for behaviour research due to its ability
to provide detailed insights into visual attention and cognitive processes.  

However, despite technological advancements, much of the existing research is limited by homogeneity in sample populations, hindering a comprehensive understanding of age-related differences in eye movement behaviours.

 The primary goal of this analysis is to address these gaps by investigating age-related
 trends in fixation durations and identifying systematic patterns in fixation behaviour
 over the course of an experiment using the Dutch Science Museum Nemo eye-tracking
 dataset.
